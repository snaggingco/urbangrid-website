Preconnected origins
preconnect hints help the browser establish a connection earlier in the page load, saving time when the first request for that origin is made. The following are the origins that the page preconnected to.
no origins were preconnected
Preconnect candidates
Add preconnect hints to your most important origins, but try to use no more than 4.

Consider modifying your JavaScript build process to not transpile Baseline features, unless you know you must support legacy browsers.

Accessibility
These checks highlight opportunities to improve the accessibility of your web app. Automatic detection can only detect a subset of issues and does not guarantee the accessibility of your web app, so manual testing is also encouraged.
Names and labels
Buttons do not have an accessible name
When a button doesn't have an accessible name, screen readers announce it as "button", making it unusable for users who rely on screen readers. Learn how to make buttons more accessible.
Failing Elements
div.flex > div.flex > div.md:hidden > button.inline-flex
<button class="inline-flex items-center justify-center gap-2 whitespace-nowrap text-sm fo…" type="button" aria-haspopup="dialog" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="radix-:r0:" data-state="closed">
These are opportunities to improve the semantics of the controls in your application. This may enhance the experience for users of assistive technology, like a screen reader.
Best practices
[user-scalable="no"] is used in the <meta name="viewport"> element or the [maximum-scale] attribute is less than 5.
Disabling zooming is problematic for users with low vision who rely on screen magnification to properly see the contents of a web page. Learn more about the viewport meta tag.
Failing Elements
head > meta
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1">
These items highlight common accessibility best practices.
Contrast
Background and foreground colors do not have a sufficient contrast ratio.
Low-contrast text is difficult or impossible for many users to read. Learn how to provide sufficient color contrast.

Crawling and Indexing
Links are not crawlable
Search engines may use href attributes on links to crawl websites. Ensure that the href attribute of anchor elements links to an appropriate destination, so more pages of the site can be discovered. Learn how to make links crawlable
