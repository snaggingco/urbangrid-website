Areas for Improvement and Potential Issues
While functional, a few aspects could be refined:
1. Code Implementation & Execution (Technical)
The provided code snippet is just the data structure. You'll need the corresponding React component (SEOComponent) that consumes this data and dynamically updates the <head> of your HTML document.
Ensure Correct Head Management: The component using this data must correctly find and update the relevant DOM elements (<title>, <meta name="description">, etc.) using document.querySelector or a library like React Helmet (or the modern react-helmet-async GitHub link).
Wouter Compatibility: Ensure the useLocation hook from wouter correctly matches the path names to the keys in your routeSEOData object, including handling potential trailing slashes or query parameters.
2. SEO Strategy & Content (Optimization)
The keywords Meta Tag: Modern search engines like Google largely ignore the keywords meta tag for ranking purposes [1]. You are better off focusing that effort on enhancing your descriptions and page content. While including them doesn't hurt, they offer minimal SEO value.
Meta Description Length: Many of your descriptions are effective. Keep them concise (around 150-160 characters) to ensure they display fully in search engine results pages (SERPs) without truncation.
Canonical URLs: The current data structure allows for a canonical URL, but none are defined in the routeSEOData object itself. For SEO best practices, every page should have a self-referencing canonical tag (e.g., the canonical for /about is yoursite.com). This is essential to prevent duplicate content issues.
og:image and Social Media Presence: While the ogImage key is present in the interface, it is missing from all your route definitions. Adding a compelling og:image (Open Graph image) for each major page is highly recommended, as it controls the image that appears when someone shares your link on platforms like LinkedIn, Facebook, or WhatsApp.
Handling Missing Routes: The current setup doesn't show how it handles routes that aren't explicitly listed in routeSEOData. Make sure you have a default fallback strategy (e.g., a generic homepage title/description) to prevent blank metadata on uncaught paths.
