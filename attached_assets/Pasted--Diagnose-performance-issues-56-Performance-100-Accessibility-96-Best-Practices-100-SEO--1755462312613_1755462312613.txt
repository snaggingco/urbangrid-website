Render blocking requests Est savings of 1,050 ms
Requests are blocking the page's initial render, which may delay LCP. Deferring or inlining can move these network requests out of the critical path.LCPFCP

Preconnected origins
preconnect hints help the browser establish a connection earlier in the page load, saving time when the first request for that origin is made. The following are the origins that the page preconnected to.
no origins were preconnected
Preconnect candidates
Add preconnect hints to your most important origins, but try to use no more than 4.

Avoid serving legacy JavaScript to modern browsers Est savings of 1 KiB
Polyfills and transforms enable legacy browsers to use new JavaScript features. However, many aren't necessary for modern browsers. Consider modifying your JavaScript build process to not transpile Baseline features, unless you know you must support legacy browsers.
