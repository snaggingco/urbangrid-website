Preconnected origins
preconnect hints help the browser establish a connection earlier in the page load, saving time when the first request for that origin is made. The following are the origins that the page preconnected to.
no origins were preconnected
Preconnect candidates
Add preconnect hints to your most important origins, but try to use no more than 4.
No additional origins are good candidates for preconnecting
